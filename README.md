## A* Algorithm

In MRover, we use A* to autonomously travel. I have never used the algorithm myself, so I thought why not learn it? To make it robotics inspired, I have some overhead images of warehouse obstacles the robot has to travel between. Given a start position and goal position, A* is used to find the optimal path and is shown in the resulting images.
